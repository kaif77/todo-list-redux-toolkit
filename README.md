# To-Do List with Redux Toolkit

A modern and efficient To-Do List application built with React and powered by Redux Toolkit for robust state management.

## Project Description

This project is a single-page application (SPA) that provides a comprehensive solution for managing daily tasks. It leverages React for the user interface and integrates Redux Toolkit, the official recommended way to write Redux logic, for predictable and centralized state management. This application demonstrates how to handle common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks, manage their completion status, and filter them efficiently using a well-structured Redux store.

## Key Features

- **Add New To-Dos:** Easily input and add new tasks to your list.
- **Mark as Complete/Incomplete:** Toggle the completion status of individual tasks.
- **Edit To-Dos:** Modify the description of existing tasks.
- **Delete To-Dos:** Remove tasks from the list when they are no longer needed.
- **Filter To-Dos:** View all tasks, only active tasks, or only completed tasks, providing a focused view.
- **State Management with Redux Toolkit:**
  - **Simplified Redux Setup:** Utilizes `configureStore` for easy store setup.
  - **createSlice:** Efficiently defines reducers and actions in a single place.
  - **Immer Integration:** Enables direct mutation of state inside reducers, which is then immutably updated behind the scenes.
  - **Thunks (Optional, for async):** If async operations are involved, `createAsyncThunk` would be used for handling them cleanly.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Organized React components for reusability and maintainability.
- **Responsive Design:** (Assumed) The application is designed to be usable across various devices and screen sizes.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the To-Do List application on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js:** Includes npm (Node Package Manager). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
  - It's recommended to use the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version.
- **npm** (comes bundled with Node.js) or **Yarn** (optional):
  - Yarn can be installed globally via npm:  
    ```
    npm install -g yarn
    ```

### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kaif77/todo-list-redux-toolkit.git
    cd todo-list-redux-toolkit
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Using Yarn (if installed):
